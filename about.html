  <div class="school">
    <h1>Academic Background</h1>
    <p> I am born and raised in San Diego, California. I attended a local high school and graduated in 2017 with honors. I attended Grossmont College, where I studied a plethora of subjects and disciplines before deciding on History. One of the areas of focus I studied briefly was Computer Science, but I ultimately decided that History was the right path for me. After my time at Grossmont, I transferred to San Diego State University in the Fall of 2020. After a year of studying History at SDSU, I decided to add Computer Science as a second major. Both of my majors helped me grow as a student and a person. History taught me to think critically, not only about the past, but about present and future. Computer Science taught me the technical and theoretical skills need to succeed within modern industries. I graduated with Cum Laude in May of 2024 with a GPA of 3.55. </p>

  <div class="work">
    <h1>Work Experience</h1>
    <p>My most recent work experience was working as an IT Technician for Associated Students of San Diego State University. It was here where I learned many valuable skills, such as troubleshooting, software management, how to manage a directory, computer/hardware management, and a little bit of system admin work from talking to my coworkers. I started working here in November of 2022. I oversaw the maintenance, repair, and management of over 250 devices spanning from Windows, Mac, and tablets.
    <br>
    <br>Before my time at Associated Students, I worked at Dick's Sporting Goods in multiple roles. Starting in September of 2018, I started off a Team Sports Associate, who helped run the Team Sports and Lodge department of the store. My main responsibilities was to keep my department running smoothly by assisting customers, stocking shelves, and maintaining a clean and organized backstock of inventory. Later in my Dick's career, I moved up to Lodge Lead, where I was running the entire department. I was solely responsible for the department in terms of cleanliness and product organization. In addition to my main responsibilities, I would also flex over to help in every department. I would assess the situation, and move to fill in the gaps of the store, whether it be helping ring customers out, helping with golf services, work on Ship from Store orders, deliver curbside orders, or help customers look for product from other departments. I had my finger on the pulse of the store and helped the entire operation run smoothly.

  <div class="interest">
    <h1> Interest</h1>
    <p>I pride myself on having a diverse and engaging set of hobbies and interest. I enjoy exercise based activities, such as: hiking, mountain biking, surfing, volleyball, golf, baseball/softball, weight lifting. When I am looking for a more relaxed activity, I spend my time researching computer science topics and exploring different software fields. I am currently practice and researching embedded systems and working on various projects. I thoroughly enjoy coding and find it rewarding to build different software systems. I am always looking to improve my coding skills and gain more knowledge, both in a theoretical sense and more practical/real-world based.
      <br><br> I also enjoy playing video games with my friends, and it is a fun activity that provides a nice social component to my life. Whether it is through video games or spending time face to face, social experience to the backbone of humanity, and relishing in time with friends is a joy and a blessing one should not take for granted.
